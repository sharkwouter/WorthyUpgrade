# WorthyUpgrade

A minecraft plugin which give players a different upgrade path. I felt that items degrading and losing everything when dying removed some of the fun from finding upgrades. To solve this, this plugin makes the following changes:

- Weapons, Tools and Armor do not lose durability
- Upon death, players do not lose items in their hotbar, offhand and armor slots
- Removes the unbreaking enchantment option for most items at the enchantment table (crossbows can still get it)
