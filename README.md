# WorthyUpgrade

A minecraft plugin which give players a different upgrade path. I felt that items degrading and losing everything when dying removed some of the fun from finding upgrades. To solve this, this plugin makes the following changes:

- Weapons, Tools and Armor do not lose durability
- Upon death, players do not lose items in their hotbar, offhand and armor slots
- Removes the unbreaking enchantment option for most items at the enchantment table (crossbows will still get it)

More coming in the future.

## Future changes
The following changes are likely to be added to this plugin in the future, but they are still being worked on:
 - Make players keep some of their XP when dying?
